# The Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity

Enzymes are essential proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms. The activity of enzymes is highly dependent on temperature, with each enzyme having an optimal temperature range at which it exhibits the highest activity. In this study, we will examine the effect of temperature on enzyme activity, specifically the enzyme catalase.

## Background

Catalase is an enzyme found in nearly all living organisms that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The activity of catalase is highly dependent on temperature, with its optimal temperature range being between 35-40°C.

## Materials and Methods

Catalase activity was measured at various temperatures using the following materials:

- Catalase enzyme solution
- Hydrogen peroxide solution
- Water bath
- Test tubes
- Pipettes
- Vernier LabQuest 2

The catalase enzyme solution was added to test tubes containing hydrogen peroxide solution, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at various temperatures between 20-60°C. The reaction was monitored by measuring the rate of oxygen production using a Vernier LabQuest 2. The data was then analyzed using a Michaelis-Menten curve to determine the optimal temperature range for catalase activity.

## Results

The data obtained from the experiment is presented in Table 1 below:

| Temperature (°C) | Oxygen Production (ml/min) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| 20               | 0.012                     |
| 25               | 0.022                     |
| 30               | 0.035                     |
| 35               | 0.043                     |
| 40               | 0.050                     |
| 45               | 0.045                     |
| 50               | 0.038                     |
| 55               | 0.025                     |
| 60               | 0.013                     |

The data was then plotted using a Michaelis-Menten curve, as shown in Figure 1 below:

$$V = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$$

**Figure 1:** Michaelis-Menten curve for the effect of temperature on catalase activity.

The curve shows that catalase activity increases with temperature up to its optimal temperature range of 35-40°C, after which it decreases rapidly. This demonstrates the importance of maintaining the correct temperature range for enzymatic activity.

## Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate the importance of temperature regulation for enzymatic activity. The optimal temperature range for catalase activity was found to be between 35-40°C, with activity decreasing rapidly outside of this range. This information is critical for the proper use of enzymes in various applications, including biotechnology, medicine, and food production.
