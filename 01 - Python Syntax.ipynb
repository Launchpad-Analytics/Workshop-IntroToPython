    "# Intro to Python: Syntax Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Part 1 of our Intro to Python workshop! In this notebook, we'll be covering the basics of Python syntax and how to use it to write simple programs. Whether you're a complete beginner to programming or have experience in other languages, this crash coruse will provide you with a solid foundation in Python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language used for a variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. It's known for its readability, simplicity, and ease of use, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll start with the fundamentals of Python syntax, including variables, data types, and basic operations. We'll also cover control structures such as conditionals and loops, as well as functions and modules. By the end of this module, you'll be able to write simple Python programs and have a good understanding of the core concepts of Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note About Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are an interactive environment for writing and running code. They allow you to write code in small, manageable chunks called \"cells\", which can be executed independently. This makes it easy to experiment with code, debug errors, and visualize data. To run a cell in a Jupyter notebook, you can click on the cell to select it, and then press the \"Run\" button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut \"Shift + Enter\" to run the cell. When you run a cell, any output generated by the code will be displayed below the cell. This can include text output, plots, tables, and other visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks also allow you to write formatted text using a markup language called Markdown. You can switch between code cells and Markdown cells by selecting the appropriate cell type from the dropdown menu in the toolbar."

    "## Hello, World!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This means that Python code is executed by an interpreter, which reads and executes Python code one line at a time, rather than compiling the entire code into a binary executable. This makes Python code easy to write, read, and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is typically written in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). There are many popular IDEs available for Python, including PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code. In this workshop, we'll be using Jupyter notebooks, which provide an interactive environment for writing and running Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is structured using whitespace, rather than using curly braces or other delimiters like many other programming languages. This means that the indentation of code is significant in Python, and code blocks are defined by the level of indentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python supports several basic data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers**: whole numbers, such as 1, 2, -3, and 0.\n",
    "- **Floats**: decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -0.5, and 2.0.\n",
    "- **Strings**: text, enclosed in quotation marks, such as \"Hello\" or \"Python\".\n",
    "- **Booleans**: True or False, used for logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the data type of a variable in Python, you can use the `type()` function. For example:"

Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number. It's also a good practice to follow a naming convention for your variables, such as using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (e.g. message_count).\n",

    "| ** | Exponentiation | 2 ** 3 evaluates to 8 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data types in Python. The basic arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**). In addition to these basic operators, there are also two additional arithmetic operators: integer division (//) and modulus (%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation operators work as expected. For example, `3 + 5` evaluates to 8, `7 - 2` evaluates to 5, `4 * 6` evaluates to 24, and `2 ** 3` evaluates to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The division operator (/) performs floating-point division, meaning that it returns a decimal number even if the inputs are integers. For example, `10 / 2` evaluates to `5.0`, not 5.\n",

    "The integer division operator (//) performs integer division, which returns the integer portion of the result, discarding any remainder. For example, `10 // 3` evaluates to 3, not 3.33333....\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 evaluates to 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the order of operations in Python follows the same rules as standard mathematics. In other words, multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction, and parentheses can be used to change the order of operations."
